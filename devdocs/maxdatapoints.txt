mdp set from GET param, but 0 if came from graphite
    -> NewPlan()
        -> plan.MaxDatapoints
            -> executePlan() -> models.NewReq()
	        -> used in alignRequests() to report on number of points that will be returned (only looks at 1 request, assumes all are same)
            -> plan.MaxDatapoints also used for final runtime consolidation

# our branch

main change is that Context and expr.Req now have MDP fields, to control (only) fetching (MDP-optimization),
whereas plan.MaxDataPoints is still the one controlling runtime consolidation and reporting on the number of points in planRequests().

mdp set from GET param, but 0 if came from graphite
    -> NewPlan()
        -> plan.MaxDatapoints 
        -> Context.MDP, though GR functions like (smart)Summarize set r.MDP =0
            -> expr.NewReqFromContext()
                -> expr.Req.MDP 
                    -> executePlan() models.NewReq() -> models.Req.MaxPoints
                        -> planRequests(): used for MDP-optimization
            -> plan.MaxDatapoints used for final runtime consolidation
	    -> and also used in planRequests() for reporting
