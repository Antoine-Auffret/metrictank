This repository is very much a work in progress, but it was suddenly at a point
where further development would be a lot easier if it could be easily folded
into the docker images, which in turn is easier if it's been tossed up
somewhere. It theoretically now will read the same queues raintank-worker does,
but does not yet do anything besides print some information about them out.

Shorter version: this is still under heavy development and everything in there
is subject to drastic change.
